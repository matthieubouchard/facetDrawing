### considerations for lidar UI

* JSON data
```
{
  facetPoints: 2d array of (x,y) points that describe a polygon, // these can also be used to find 2d area but I'm not sure how to calculate it with slope. These points may initially come from image coordinates, but could be geoCoordinates. I think these come from the facet masks from facet points we should be able to determine area, and then once we have slope, can adjust for
